Demo of Creating a Metal Texture from AVCaptureSession and Applying MetalPerformanceShaders In-Place

This project is the companion to this blog post: http://flexmonkey.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/generating-filtering-metal-textures.html

In a nutshell, it creates an RBG Metal texture from camera input and applies a Metal Performance Shader Gaussian blur to it.
